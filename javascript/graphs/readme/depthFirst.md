Conduct a depth first preorder traversal on a graph

## Features

- Write the following method for the Graph class:

    Name: Depth first
    Arguments: Node (Starting point of search)
    Return: A collection of nodes in their pre-order depth-first traversal order
    Program output: Display the collection
  
- write tests for every possible senario
