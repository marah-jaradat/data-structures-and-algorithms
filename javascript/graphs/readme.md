# Implementation: Graphs

The graph is a non-linear data structure. Graph G contains a set of vertices V and a set of Edges E. Graph has lots of applications in computer science. 

## Features

Implement your own Graph. The graph should be represented as an adjacency list, and should include the following methods:

    - add node
    - add edge
    - get nodes
    - get neighbors
    - size

- Write tests to prove the following functionality


### Efficiency

| method|Time complexity |Space complexity | 
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
|addNode|O(1): | O(1)|
|addEdge|O(1): | O(n)|
|getNodes|O(1): | O(1)|
|getNeighbors|O(1): | O(1)|
|size|O(1): | O(1)|
