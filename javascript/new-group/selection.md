# Selection Sort

Selection Sort is a sorting algorithm that traverses the array multiple times as it slowly builds out the sorting sequence. The traversal keeps track of the minimum value and places it in the front of the array which should be incrementally sorted.

## Features

**### sorted**

- Create a selection-sort function
-For your own understanding, consider also stepping through these inputs:
    Reverse-sorted: [20,18,12,8,5,-2]
    Few uniques: [5,12,7,5,5,7]
    Nearly-sorted: [2,3,5,7,13,11]
- Write tests to prove the following functionality

    
## Approach & Efficiency

| method|Time complexity |Space complexity | 
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| sort|O(n):based on the no. of nodes | O(n): based on the height of the tree|
