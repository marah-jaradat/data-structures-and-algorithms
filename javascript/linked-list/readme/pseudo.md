# Implementation: stack-queue-pseudo

Create a new class called pseudo queue.
Do not use an existing Queue.
Instead, this PseudoQueue class will implement our standard queue interface (the two methods listed below),
Internally, utilize 2 Stack instances to create and manage the queue

## Features

1. Create Methods:
   - enqueue
   Arguments: value
   Inserts value into the PseudoQueue, using a first-in, first-out approach.
   - dequeue
   Arguments: none
   Extracts a value from the PseudoQueue, using a first-in, first-out approach.h

2. Write tests to prove the following functionality

## Approach & Efficiency

| method|Time complexity |Space complexity | 
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| enqueue|O(1): because used if | O(1)|
| dequeue|O(1): |O(1) |
